    "After intuition fails you, try and write what you are thinking, it help clear the mind (and avoid desparate, time wasting, debugging). The scientific method provides a great framework for that:\n",

    "Write down the problem you’re trying to fix, and write down any observations about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "a description of the theory you are about to test\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experiment\n",
    "a description of the metrics you’re going to look at, code you’re going to change, query you’re going to run, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "Roughly what results you expect. If it’s a database query, often a count of rows. If its a log file, the line(s) you’re looking for. If it’s a metric, a trend and some limits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actual Results\n",
    "The results of the experiment. I like pasting in screenshots of graphs for metrics, the actual log lines, query results etc."
